Version 1.1

-It is now possible to identify the terrains through 'physics material'.
-A variable was added allowing continuous traces to be generated.
-Some improvements were made in performance.






Version 1.2

- More demonstration scenes added
- Now you can use a custom material to create skid marks.
- Improvements in codes






Version 1.3

- Now a system of skid sounds accompanies the asset, allowing you to set up skid sounds in the standard way, but also lets you set up sounds for various terrains.
- More demonstration scenes added
- Improvements in codes






Version 1.3.1

- New 3d model for the scenario.






Version 1.5.0

- It is now possible to set a maximum size for the 'skidMarks'
- The code has been reworked, and now reaches up to 800FPS, as it has been extremely optimized.






Version 1.6.0

- The camera following the vehicle has been replaced by an orbital camera.
- The objects that the code generates were centered on a single master object called 'MsSkidMarksSystem_Meshes'.
- The maximum limit of skid marks has been reduced from 30000 to 12000 to avoid possible errors.
